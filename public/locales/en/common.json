  "In recent years, my journey in development has been marked by a challenging narrative, filled with achievements and significant learnings. When I embarked on this journey, I faced a steep learning curve, delving into the complexities of both front-end and back-end. Every line of code was an accomplishment, and every challenge was an opportunity for growth. Crafting intuitive interfaces and architecting robust solutions became my daily mantra.\n\nHowever, the true essence of development goes beyond the code. I found myself consistently challenged to translate customer needs into tangible solutions. Additionally, the importance of data security and respect for user privacy became integral aspects of my daily work.\n\nThese years in development are not just a chapter but the foundation for what lies ahead. I am excited to embrace future opportunities, apply the knowledge gained, and contribute to shaping the ever-evolving technological landscape.": "In recent years, my journey in development has been marked by a challenging narrative, filled with achievements and significant learnings.

Additionally, it allows the updating and monitoring of these operations based on real data, enabling comparisons between the planned and the executed.\n\nDynamic Risk Advisor (DRA): I temporarily participated in the development of the DRA project, a tool based on the bowtie methodology, allowing the user to manage and monitor barriers and alerts in real-time, aiming for optimized operational risk management.": "Sequence Builder + Cost Tracker: I was among the main contributors to the development of Sequence Builder, a system that generates simulations resulting in a sequence of operations with time estimates based on historical data for planning oil well activities.
